# Smart Home CLI Application (Java, OOP, Collections)

## Project Overview

A Java-based **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** application that simulates smart home device management with customizable rooms and devices.

## Features

- Create and manage multiple rooms
- Add or remove smart devices (e.g., smart plugs, lights)
- Control device states (turn on/off lights, plugs, etc.)
- Track and display the state of each room and its devices in real-time
- Menu-driven CLI for user-friendly interaction

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Java Collections Framework.
- Command-Line Interface (CLI)

## Learning Focus

- Applying OOP concepts in a real-world simulation
- Managing dynamic data using Java Collections
- Building stateful CLI-based applications
